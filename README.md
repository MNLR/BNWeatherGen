# BNWeatherGen
## Weather Generators with Bayesian Networks.

Implements Bayesian networks as discrete multivariate weather generators. A small tutorial with several examples is provided in the [companion notebook](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/notebooks/blob/master/2019_BNWeatherGen_WRR.ipynb).

This document presents the R code that reproduces the Bayesian network models of the paper *Multisite Weather Generators using Bayesian Networks: An illustrative case study for precipitation occurrence*, submitted to **Water Resources Research**. It also has some experimental functionality not restricted to weather generators, like predictive networks intended for downscaling.
